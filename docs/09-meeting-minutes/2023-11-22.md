Nov 22 Client meet with Andriy
Started @ 8, ended 8:33pm
In attendance: Andriy, Daniel, Dish, Jodi, Phil

### Agenda
To Show:
- Subgraph navigation improvements
- Updated node colours and icons
- Autosave
- Copy-and-paste

Main thing coming up for next sprint:
- new documents
- visual upgrades

To-do in meeting: check if there is anything else andriy feels is critical to do before semester end

### Functionality and interface feedback

Higher importance:

Multiple Documents Feature

- timeline for us is to prioritize this for the next two weeks to implement support for multiple documents

Subgraph-related: wants drag & multiselect to be more actionable with subgraph creation

- facilitate ‚Äúcleaning up‚Äù of parent graphs by tucking selected leaf nodes into a subgraph either automatically or with simple action
- ‚Äúenter subgraph‚Äù button is too prominent, consider using a subtle icon in the top right corner of the node or implement a double-click action for entering a subgraph
- consider using a double border like the goal node to indicate a node has subgraphs

Visuals feedback

- make leaf nodes white, just white
- arrow pointing sideways is a concern, consider make them point flat
- when nodes are selected in multi-selected area, make them bold or use another obvious visual cue in the UI

Issues that have been solved or will be shelved:

- mouse zoom changed to finger panning by Daniel
- line routing has difficulties in differentiating lines coming in or going out but don‚Äôt have a good alternative currently

Overall satisfaction: positive feedback, user seems satisfied with the current state. üéâ

### Misc

Large System Refactoring Tool Naming and Approach:

Naming Considerations:

- maybe go for a name that appeals to computer science professionals.
- do not use just ‚ÄúMikado‚Äù

Presentation Strategy:

- emphasize the application's use cases rather than just its tools
- consider mock mission-critical code that requires refactoring
- make the presentation memorable by using convincing and even exaggerated cases
- schedule a meeting with Andriy to practice final pitch/demo on the Monday before Dec 7
