## Good feedback on features demo'd in current iteration:
- likes microinteraction on overlappin/interacting nodes
- likes the fact that the color indicators change themselves because he is tired of having to do it manually in his current tool
- overall good as far as a univerisity level class project goes

## Important issues:
- arrows: visually cluttered, instinctively want to organize them by interacting with them (select/grouping/dragging to move position) or prefers the "smoothstep" style of React Flow (similar to arrows he use in Obsidian Canvas), specifically wants us to make arrows less dark, match arrow color to the grey of the borders, thinner
- nodes aesthetics including colors and icons:
    - node colors and icons are overwhelming, prefers black text on white
    - fewer/more dilute colors, ad libbed "try one color and one icon"
    - make leaf nodes white and blocked nodes blue (more intuitive)
    - undecided on whether to keep color or icons, last mentioned is maybe getting rid of colors to keep icons, basically wants some kind of optimal minimalism but isn't sure himself, wants us to design it better
    - wants a better font too
- subgraph: wants this implemented
    - suggests having subgraph indicated by a node with a non-directed edge (refer to how he currently scuffs it in Obsidian Canvas or implement something better)
- autosave with every movement

## More wishlist items
- ctrl-z undo
- 2-finger swipe to zoom (laptop/desktop?)
- wants to be able to export graph and be able to load it back in
- hover on node interactivity to give information
- suggested a lasso tool to move nodes into subgraphs
- something better than the toolbar on top when clicking nodes
- button to remove completion looks like delete button
