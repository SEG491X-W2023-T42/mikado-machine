# mikado-machine

## Introduction

The Mikado Method is a software development methodology that aims to address complex problems in a structured and systematic manner. It helps teams to understand the dependencies and relationships between different parts of a system and prioritize the changes that need to be made. Traditionally, the Mikado Method is performed with pen and paper, which was intended to facilitate the process with no upfront investment for Agile performance. The client for this project, Andriy Drozdyuk, who is a machine learning and deep learning programmer, is seeking an electronic method to perform the Mikado Method to aid in code refactoring activities for his work.
