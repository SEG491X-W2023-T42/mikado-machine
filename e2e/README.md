# Browser end-to-end (E2E) tests

The tests will automatically launch a browser.
To allow one to see the action performed and demo them, headless mode is disabled and a delay is inserted after each click.

## Usage

1. Start the Firebase emulators
2. Start the React development server
3. Run `npm test` here

The result of the testing will be shown in the console by Jest.
